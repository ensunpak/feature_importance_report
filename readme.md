As part of my research on feature importance in machine learning, I conducted a detailed study on the most commonly used algorithms for this purpose. I have documented my findings in a Jupyter notebook, which is available in this Github repository. The report presents several use cases to explain the practicality and applications of various feature importance methods, such as wrapper, filter, and embedded methods. Through these examples, I discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and how they can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models.
